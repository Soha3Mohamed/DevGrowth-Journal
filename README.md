# DevGrowth-Journal

This is my personal journal to track my growth as a .NET backend developer.

Sometimes it feels like there are just too many things to figure out—and in those moments, I start believing that I’m not learning fast enough, or maybe not growing at all.

This journal is my way of fighting back against that voice.

I’m focusing on:
- Writing clean, reliable code
- Building projects that reflect real-world scenarios
- Becoming someone who trusts their own decisions in code

I’ll log my reflections, lessons, and progress weekly—honestly and simply.
