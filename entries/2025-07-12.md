## What I am doing these days
- Currently i started working on a new api -> LmsApi
- The goal from this api is to strengthen my knowledge in authentication and authorization by working on many scenarios and sides like JWTs, register and login, Role-based decisions and others
- Of course this api is also leveling up the difficulty in all concepts comapred to my last one but i feel good

## üß† What I learned this week
- I know it is a simple thing but I set up the structure of the project in a clean way and it will be improved
- Applied ServiceResult<T> as a result wrapper ti make error handling customized and more comfortable for users

## ‚ùì What still confuses me
- Proper Structure for User-related enpoints( AuthController seperated from UserController or all in one?, also should all user-related logic go into one serivce ot seperate also?)
- Actual implementation of JWTs

## ‚úÖ What I‚Äôm proud of
- I read about JWTs but didn't let the knowledge stop me from applying

## üìå What I‚Äôll focus on next
- I will work on making the User service a good designed one and apply authentication, authorization
- I don't want to touch courses or lessons now but i will write tests early (using xunit and InMemoryDB)
