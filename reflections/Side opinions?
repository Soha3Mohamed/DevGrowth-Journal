I'm using Chatgpy as a overview instructor, whenever i need to get exposed to a new concept, i ask chatgpt for a detailed overview 
 and i remind him to tell me important questions that may not be in articles like:
 What is the basic use for that library or code?
 What are alternatives and are they more common? 
 WHat are best practices when dealing with this code?
 If there are new files, where should I replace them ? under Helpers folder or what?
 and what are concepts i should consider later to strengthen my knowledge in the concept i am asking about?

these assure me that i said a good hello to the concept and now i am ready to know it better like a friend
